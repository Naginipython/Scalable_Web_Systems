## Time Management

*Question 1:* How much time did it take you to complete this exercise? Was the allocated 50-minute time frame sufficient?

*Answer 1:* This took maybe 15 minutes. Fairly simple exercise.

*Question 2:* Did any specific part of the exercise require more time than you anticipated?

*Answer 2:* It took an extra minute to look up how to build a .dev file, but it wasn't difficult

## Difficulty Level

*Question 3:* How would you rate the overall difficulty of this exercise on a scale from 1 (very easy) to 10 (very difficult)?

*Answer 3:* 1/10

*Question 4:* Were there any parts of the exercise that you found particularly challenging or easier than expected?

*Answer 4:* None in particular. I just need to make sure I retain the concepts.

## Learning Experience

*Question 5:* What new skills or knowledge did you gain from completing this exercise?

*Answer 5:* Well, the course as a whole, a WHOLE LOT. I never quite understood a lot about Node and Express when learning under Prof. Emery in CS326, but the practice and repetition here has been huge. Node, JavaScript, and Svelte may become a specialty, seeing as though it's fairly big in the market, I've heard.

*Question 6:* Did this exercise deepen your understanding of Docker, Node.js, and logging with Winston? If so, how?

*Answer 6:* It's very cool that docker can be actively updated with volume linking, it makes the process signigicantly more appealing. Winston hasn't used here, so nothing changed about that.

## Practical Application

*Question 7:* How do you think the skills learned in this exercise will be applicable in your future projects or career?

*Answer 7:* Assuming I can find a job, I'd bet it'd be something that uses these subjects, since it's now one of my most confident skills. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has always been high up there, but Node and Svelte has been big.

*Question 8:* Did the exercise provide a good balance of theoretical knowledge and practical application?

*Answer 8:* Absolutely. Docker took a minute, and I want to do more practice with it, but I can easily see it's application.

## Instruction Clarity

*Question 9:* Were the instructions and objectives of the exercise clear and easy to follow?

*Answer 9:* Way too simple, I'd say.

*Question 10:* Did you find any part of the instructions ambiguous or lacking in detail?

*Answer 10:* Only possible issue is to change Dockerfile.dev to Dockerfile, or to change todo 4 to add "-f Dockerfile.dev"

*Question 11:* Did you like the format of this exercise as compared to the quiz format we have been using in Canvas?

*Answer 11:* Much more so. More details last beta.

## Suggestions for Improvement

*Question 12:* Are there any aspects of the exercise that you think could be improved or modified for a better learning experience?

*Answer 12:* I'd like more complexity, possibly have us create out own Dockerfile.

*Question 13:* Would you suggest adding any additional components or concepts to this exercise?

*Answer 13:* It'd be cool to create a Compose as shown

## Overall Satisfaction

*Question 14:* Overall, how satisfied are you with this learning exercise?

*Answer 14:* 3/5. I really like the subject and can see why it's something I need to learn, but being this simple, I don't know if I can retain it.

## Any Other Comments

*Question 15:* Do you have any further comments about this assignment?

*Answer 15:* Nope!

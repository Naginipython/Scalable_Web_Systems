# COMMENTS

Please place answer the questions below as part of this assignment. Your comments will not be used against you. We are looking for constructive feedback that can help us create better and more engaging assignments.

## Time Management

*Question 1:* How much time did it take you to complete this exercise? Was the allocated 50-minute time frame sufficient?

*Answer 1:* It didn't take too long, I mostly needed to copy-paste code and commands. The only part that took extra time was the file path typo from part 6.

*Question 2:* Did any specific part of the exercise require more time than you anticipated?

*Answer 2:* The file path typo from part 6. Supposedly, $(pwd) will cause an issue for windows users, I hear.

## Difficulty Level

*Question 3:* How would you rate the overall difficulty of this exercise on a scale from 1 (very easy) to 10 (very difficult)?

*Answer 3:* I'd rate it a 1 for the exercise in itself, but ~5 for the learning aspect, I don't fully understand the commands and how to craft my own Dockerfile. I will need to watch the 1hr long video, and possibly other videos for further docker knowledge. Maybe get a cheatsheet.

*Question 4:* Were there any parts of the exercise that you found particularly challenging or easier than expected?

*Answer 4:* I don't fully understand Dockerfiles, I don't remember enough about docker commands to debug docker.

## Learning Experience

*Question 5:* What new skills or knowledge did you gain from completing this exercise?

*Answer 5:* I find myself really liking the idea of Docker, being able to contain everything my app needs in an environment of only things I need. I just don't fully understand what to do AFTER docker. Does this run on windows? Only linux? Where are common places I'm unknowling using docker?

*Question 6:* Did this exercise deepen your understanding of Docker, Node.js, and logging with Winston? If so, how?

*Answer 6:* This helped my understanding of docker to some extent, I was wondering how a dev goes from making an app from a file system, upload to docker, then changing code and updating docker. I'd like more practice to fully understand the extent of this, though.

## Practical Application

*Question 7:* How do you think the skills learned in this exercise will be applicable in your future projects or career?

*Answer 7:* I am unsure, I don't know of any apps that use docker.

*Question 8:* Did the exercise provide a good balance of theoretical knowledge and practical application?

*Answer 8:* I'd like more practice to fully grasp theoretical knowledge.

## Instruction Clarity

*Question 9:* Were the instructions and objectives of the exercise clear and easy to follow?

*Answer 9:* The instructions, typo aside, were very straightforward for a Linux user. 

*Question 10:* Did you find any part of the instructions ambiguous or lacking in detail?

*Answer 10:* Going for a purely completion standpoint, no. Form a knowledge standpoint? I wish there was more to ponder and debug/experiment.

*Question 11:* Did you like the format of this exercise as compared to the quiz format we have been using in Canvas?

*Answer 11:* This is fairly preferable to me. An advantage for the quizzes is that you, the professor, can see it working with pictures. But for the student, its nice to not rely on images, and I don't like the quiz timer because I hate the big number. I also like seeing the task before pressing "take the quiz."

## Suggestions for Improvement

*Question 12:* Are there any aspects of the exercise that you think could be improved or modified for a better learning experience?

*Answer 12:* I'd like more challenge, and to force the student to make their own Dockerfile, as well as needing to know docker commands.

*Question 13:* Would you suggest adding any additional components or concepts to this exercise?

*Answer 13:* I'd like more exercises to practice more Docker concepts, and memorize this from muscle memory.

## Overall Satisfaction

*Question 14:* Overall, how satisfied are you with this learning exercise?

*Answer 14:* I'd say 1/5. I feel like this will be somewhat forgettable, and I'll really learn more from trying to make my own file based on the Canvas notes and YouTube.

## Any Other Comments

*Question 15:* Do you have any further comments about this assignment?

*Answer 15:* To summarize, I'd like this to be more challenging and I'd like more exercises.
